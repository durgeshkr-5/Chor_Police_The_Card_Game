# Chor_Police_The_Card_Game
Chor Police is a digital remake of the classic childhood game. Four players take on roles of Raja, Mantri, Sipahi, and Chor, earning points each round. Sipahi must guess the Chorâ€”right guess or wrong guess changes the score. A nostalgic blend of fun and coding, reborn for the digital age.
